- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChillHumanoid, but you can call me Kirsten.
- 🔮 I'm a self-taught programmer, trying to make it big someday soon!
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Design, Automation, and App Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
- 💞️ In my free time, I like to hike, ride my motorcycle, and work on training with my one-year-old Great Dane pup.
- 📫 If you happen to have any advice or general tips for beginner programmers, feel free to reach out to me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/artofcoding.exe/)
